Pixels were classified to land cover categories from multispectral Landsat and HJ-1 images, plus auxiliary data. In isolated areas without GlobeLand30 coverage, GlobCover 2009 land cover was used instead (Copyright ESA GlobCover Project, led by MEDIAS-France). OpenStreetMap land polygons were used to mask sea pixels.";

  descriptions["beta_diversity"] = "Georeferenced occurrence records for plants and terrestrial vertebrates were retrieved from GBIF (see page three). Species records were combined with environmental covariates to express the pattern of biodiversity (beta-diversity, i.e. spatial turnover in species) across the area of interest. To do this, a Generalised Dissimilarity Model (GDM; Ferrier et al 2002) was run. The environmental covariates used in the model were annual mean temperature, annual mean precipitation, temperature seasonality, precipitation seasonality (Hijmans et al 2005), soil nitrogen, soil water holding capacity (Land and Water Development Division, FAO 2003), and land cover class (GlobCover 2009). To ensure the maximum number of records for modelling, occurrence data were obtained for the area of interest and a surrounding 3-degree buffer.";
  descriptions["vulnerability"] = "The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN 2014) was queried to find the names of threatened species in the specified area of interest. All terrestrial amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, and plants determined by the IUCN to be either Critically endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), Vulnerable (VU), or Near Threatened (NT) were extracted. The Red List also identified the countries and sub-national administrative regions where each species is native (excluding areas where the species is vagrant or introduced). <br><br>The Global Administrative Areas database version 2.0 (www.gadm.org) was then used to create polygons comprising all the administrative regions in each species range defined by the IUCN. Each polygon represented the potential maximum extent of occurrence, within which a species distribution should be modelled. The same extent was used to sample background environmental variables for species distribution modelling. <br><br>For each threatened species, all unique geo-referenced records within the potential maximum extent were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, gbif.org). A set of environmental covariates was then created for each location with a GBIF record. The covariates used were land cover from GlobCover 2009, mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality, total annual precipitation, and precipitation seasonality from Hijmans (2005), and elevation and slope from Farr (2007). <br><br>The potential distribution of each threatened species with more than 10 unique occurrence records was modelled using MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy Algorithm; Phillips et al., 2006). MaxEnt creates a climate suitability model for each species, predicting where a species could potentially occur based on habitat conditions. <br><br>A list of the threatened vertebrate species included in modelling can be found in Appendix 1.";
  descriptions["intactness"] = "To identify patches of intact habitat in the specified area of interest, the land cover map (see page four) was reclassified. Pixels in the urban/artificial, bare ground, and snow/ice categories were omitted from consideration. Every remaining pixel was assigned to a group of neighbouring pixels with the same land cover class, and the area of each group in hectares was calculated. In the resulting map those areas with a greater intact patch size are less fragmented, and carry a higher ecological value.";
  descriptions["migratory_buffered"] = "To remotely characterise important migratory routes, the Global Register of Migratory Species (GROMS; www.groms.de; Riede 2004) was queried. This database provides a list of migratory vertebrate specie (terrestrial birds and mammals) and digital maps describing migratory routes. Grids for all species shown to have a migratory route across the area of interest were added together to yield an estimate of migratory species density.";
  descriptions["wetlands"] = "Wetlands and drainage channels are also important for supporting the migration of species across landscapes. A measure of wetland dispersal corridors in the specified area of interest was derived from the land cover map described on page four. Pixels within 100 metres of water bodies were identified. Those buffer zones, along with pixels classed as Inland water or Wetland, were assigned a high ecological value of 1.  All other land pixels were given a value of 0 for this measure of connectivity.";
  descriptions["resilience"] = "The resilience of vegetation to climate perturbations was estimated using monthly time series of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and three climate variables over the period 2000-2013. A PCA regression was performed between EVI and air temperature, the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration, and cloud cover. This identified the months when EVI is related to climate drivers and measured the strength of that relationship over 14 years. For those months with a strong climate response, variability in vegetation productivity was divided by climate variability as a metric of vegetation sensitivity. <br><br>In the resultant resilience map, high values indicate areas where vegetation greenness showed relatively little change despite fluctuations in climate. Low resilience values reveal areas where photosynthetic activity changed even in the face of small fluctuations in climate. For full details of the methodology used to calculate the resilience metric please see Seddon et al (2016).";
  descriptions["sev"] = "In addition to the preceding maps, a summary ecological valuation (SEV) was calculated for the specified area of interest. In this, each of the above layers was standardised into a map of Z-scores. Z-scores were then added together to show the landscape pattern of each layer on a scale comparable to all the other layers. Pixels with a high Z-score are areas which appear to be relatively important in a number of the preceding analyses (e.g. more resilient, higher number of threated species, higher levels of beta-diversity etc) and therefore are of high ecological risk if damaged. In contrast, those with a low score are less ecologically important. ";

                <p>The Local Ecological Footprinting Tool (LEFT) was developed to provide a simple-to-use tool for industries and landowners who have to make quick preliminary decisions about land-use change, and to assist in minimising the environmental impact of their operations.</p>
                <p>The tool processes a series of high-quality open-access environmental datasets using standardised algorithms to produce maps at 30m resolution of land cover class, number of globally threatened terrestrial vertebrate and plant species, biodiversity of terrestrial vertebrates and plants, habitat intactness, wetland habitat connectivity, number of migratory species, and vegetation resilience. These results are aggregated in a single summary map showing the pattern of relative ecological value.</p>
                <p>This report briefly describes the methods and datasets used to generate the maps for the specified area of interest. Further details on the modelling approach, datasets, and choice of ecological variables can be found in Willis et al. (2012; 2014; 2015), Seddon et al. (2016), and Long et al. (2016 – in press)</p>

                <hr/>
                <p>The output and validity of results will be significantly influenced by the availability or, conversely, the paucity, of data available in the databases for the selected region. The most critical data in this respect are the species occurrence records contained in GBIF. Due to sampling bias, GBIF coverage for some regions of the world is better than others (Gaiji et al., 2012). In order to provide a first estimate of the confidence that can be placed in the output from a region, a metric to assess the density of species occurrence records was devised. In this, the number of species records was obtained from GBIF for each taxonomic group (amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals, plants) in the user-specified area of interest, as well as in a much larger reference area comprising the WWF ecoregions that intersect the area of interest. Species density was then calculated by dividing the number of different species in an area by the size of the area raised to an exponent of 0.2. Exponentiation is necessary in order to consistently control for the logarithmic form of species-area relationships and allow species densities from areas of different sizes to be directly comparable (Rosenweig 2012). The density of local species occurrence records for a taxonomic group can be compared to the density of records for the same group in the much larger reference area. This gives a first approximation of the degree to which the GBIF records available for a specified area of interest provide a good representation of the species expected in that area, based on wider biogeographical patterns and species-area relationships.</p>
                <p>The table below shows species densities for the area of interest and the broader reference area, and the ratio of those densities. A representation score above 1.0 means that the number of species records retrieved was higher than expected, so the data are more reliable. Representation below 1.0 indicates poorer GBIF coverage and less reliable species data.</p>

              <p>To appreciate the importance of the ecological values obtained for the specified area of interest relative to other regions, a 'compared to other areas metric' (COAM) was calculated. This metric used the polygons of the WWF Terrestrial Ecoregion Classification (Olson et al, 2001) to identify zones ecologically similar to the area of interest. Zonal statistics were then used to assess the importance of each LEFT layer relative to the same measure over the entire ecoregion. For each layer, the difference in standard scores between the area of interest and the broader ecoregions is presented in the following chart. This shows whether a study area is relatively more or less ecologically valuable than other regions with similar biogeographic characterisitics.</p>
